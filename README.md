## Project Overview

During the past years, I have fulfilled my passion for traveling by working as a Cabin Crew in Dubai. There is no sentence I have heard more often than: "Take care of the customers, because there is no airline without customers." This statement is as obvious as it is true. A customer's journey begins when they book their ticket and does not conclude until they leave the airport at their destination. Throughout that process, every small detail can make the trip extraordinary or turn it into a disaster. Being on board and hearing firsthand thousands of different experiences has provided me with a deep understanding of customers' preferences. With the increasing competition in the aviation industry, leveraging this knowledge could significantly benefit a company’s reputation, increasing their number of travelers and revenue.

The aim of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Sentiment Analysis on airline reviews to understand customer satisfaction and identify key factors influencing their experiences. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in customer reviews and combining it with my real-life knowledge and experience, I expect to uncover insights that can help improve airline services and enhance customer satisfaction.

This project is divided into three main steps with future improvements in mind:

1. **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset.
   - Use my experience to create new features from the existing data that could add value to the analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning**
   - Perform EDA on the available features.
   - Compare performance across different airlines.
   - Determine key features affecting customer loyalty.
   - Support these results with supervised machine learning models, utilizing the ‘Recommended’ and ‘Overall Rating’ values as targets.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - Analyze passenger comments using NLP techniques.
   - Extract deeper insights and understand sentiments expressed.
